        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>2 ounces chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>85 grams Riced cauliflower (3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>95 grams California style vegetables (approximately 1 cup)</li>
            <li>30 grams mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 small cherry tomato</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Steps-->
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook one chicken tenderloin in a skillet, on a grill, or in the oven. (I used a George Foreman mini grill and it only took about 5 minutes)</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, saut√© mushrooms over a hot skillet, with cooking spray. Once mushrooms are almost done, add 1 cup of frozen veggies, like the California blend (containing carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower).</li>
            <li>Heat riced cauliflower in microwave, for about 2 minutes. Drain and squeeze out any extra liquid. Blot with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl and eat.</li>
            <li>I've used different seasonings for this meal. Not all at the same time, but I flip around using salt, pepper, fat free sour cream, light mayo, mustard, ranch seasoning, butter flavored sprays, ranch dressing, or just plain.</li>
        </ol>
